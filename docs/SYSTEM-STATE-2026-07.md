# SYSTEM STATE — 2026-07-10

**Single source of truth for what the FSM platform actually is today**, reconciled against the
doc set. Code is truth; docs are claims. Every statement cites evidence (`file:line`, migration
name, test, commit). Inference is marked `[INFERRED]`; anything not directly verified is marked
`[UNVERIFIED]`. Written on branch `feat/autoplant-integration` at commit `eeb5601` (plus an
uncommitted working-tree layer of admin-UI polish + device/schedule read tweaks — see §1.5).

Section order is the resume order for future sessions.

## 1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### 1.1 What the platform is

A GPS Field Service Management platform for a fleet-telematics fitment business: GPS devices are
fitted on customer vehicles at plants; when a device stops reporting, the platform detects it,
opens a ticket, recommends a Service Engineer (SE), dispatches a day plan, and tracks the field
loop (troubleshoot → GPS-verified fix → reports). Two user-facing products over one backend:

- **Admin Web Dashboard** — React 18 + TypeScript + Vite SPA (`apps/admin/`), role-variant UI for
  Zone Manager (ZM), CSM, Operations Head (OH), Warehouse Manager (WM).
- **SE Mobile App** — React Native + Expo (`apps/mobile/`) — **auth shell only** today: login /
  session / token store (14 files, `apps/mobile/src/auth/*`, `apps/mobile/app/index.tsx`).
  Issue #54 (Mobile Foundation) is not done; every M-series mobile surface is unbuilt.
- **Backend** — NestJS modular monolith (`apps/backend/`), Postgres 16 + PostGIS via Prisma 7,
  reading from the external **AutoPlant** MySQL system over VPN.

### 1.2 The funnel (one diagram)

```
AutoPlant MySQL (VPN, read-only)
  │  masters daily · telemetry every 30 min          [IntegrationSchedulerService — env-gated OFF]
  ▼
[a] Master sync  ─ ap_masters → companies/plants/vehicles/transporters (ACTIVE plants, DEPLOYED
  │                devices, zone-normalised via zone_mapping, else UNZONED)   master-sync.service.ts
  ▼
[b] Snapshot ingestion ─ keyset reader ≤90 rows/query → raw_device_snapshots (daily partitions)
  │                      run ledger + stale-run reaper            snapshot-ingestion.worker.ts
  ▼
[c] Device-state recompute ─ set-based upsert of device_states (inactivity hrs, SLA bucket,
  │                          eligibility)                          device-state.service.ts
  ▼
[d] Ticket creation ─ inactive + eligible → OPEN ticket + failure_cycle    [gated: eligibility_mode
  │                                                     ='pgi' over empty pgi_history ⇒ 0 today]
  ▼
[e] Recommender ─ hard filters + scoring + canonical sort → recommendations (SUGGESTED)
  │                                                                 recommender.service.ts
  ▼
[f] Batch dispatch ─ SUGGESTED→DISPATCHED, work_schedules Day Plan (transactional, advisory-
  │                  locked, idempotent)  batch-assignment.service.ts · daily cron dispatch-
  │                  scheduler.service.ts               [BUSINESS_SWEEPS_ENABLED, default OFF]
  ▼
[g] Field loop ─ SE soft states · troubleshoot submission · intraday CRITICAL insertion ·
  │              ZM override/same-day · cross-zone escalation · install & recovery lifecycles ·
  │              inventory/van stock/component requests
  ▼
[h] Verification ─ first-valid-ping GPS sweeps → CLOSED / PARTIAL_RECOVERY / failed
  ▼
[i] Reports ─ monthly/daily aggregation cubes → fleet uptime, root cause, efficiency, ZM scorecard
```

**Funnel status (verified 2026-07-09, `INDEX.md:124-139`, spot-checked this session):** every stage
is code-complete and tested; activation is blocked by (1) empty `engineer_master`/`se_coverage`
data, (2) the B7 eligibility business decision (`pgi_history` empty), and (3) two deliberately-OFF
ops switches (`INGESTION_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`, `BUSINESS_SWEEPS_ENABLED`). Nothing runs unattended
today. See §6.

### 1.3 Runtime topology

| Component | Reality | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | Single NestJS process, port `PORT ?? 3000`, global prefix `/api`, CORS to `ADMIN_ORIGIN ?? http://localhost:5173` | `main.ts:9`, `app.config.ts:9-13` |
| Primary DB | Postgres 16 + PostGIS, Prisma 7 (`prisma@^7.8.0`), 55 migrations `20260617103804_init…` → `20260709120000_intraday_one_live_offer` | `apps/backend/prisma/migrations/` |
| External source | AutoPlant MySQL over VPN, `mysql2@^3.15.3`, lazy pool, unset env ⇒ empty/mock sources so dev/CI boots | `ingestion.module.ts` (`readAutoPlantMysqlConfig()===null` branches) |
| Cron | **In-process** `@nestjs/schedule@^4.1.2` only. Two scheduler homes: `IntegrationSchedulerService` (ingestion, owns `ScheduleModule.forRoot()` in `ingestion.module.ts`) and `BusinessSweepSchedulerModule`+`DispatchSchedulerService` (field-loop sweeps + daily dispatch) | `ingestion.module.ts`, `scheduling/business-sweep-scheduler.service.ts`, `scheduling/dispatch-scheduler.service.ts` |
| Queueing | **None.** No Redis, no BullMQ, no S3 in `apps/backend/package.json` — CLAUDE.md's "Redis/BullMQ, S3" line is aspirational, not current (§4 correction) | `package.json` deps grep |
| Auth store | **In-memory** users + refresh tokens (`InMemoryUserStore`/`InMemoryRefreshTokenStore`); DB `users` table exists but cannot log in — owned by open issue #91 | `auth/user-store.ts`, `auth/refresh-token-store.ts` |
| Deployment | **None** — no Dockerfile, no compose, no runbook (issue #111 open) | repo root inspection; `docs/audits/2026-07-07-…reaudit.md` |

### 1.4 Module map

`AppModule` (`app.module.ts:80-106`) imports 24 feature modules and mounts ~45 controllers at the
app level; guards `AuthGuard → RoleGuard → ZoneScopeGuard` are providers applied per-controller
via `@UseGuards` — **there is no global `APP_GUARD`** (issue #99 open; an unguarded controller is
silently public).

| Module | Responsibility | Notable exports / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `prisma` | PrismaService singleton | imported everywhere |
| `auth` | Login/refresh/JWT (HS256 `{user_id, role, zone_id}`), scrypt hashes, 15-min access / 30-day rotating refresh | in-memory stores (→ #91); `acting-context.ts` acting-role attribution |
| `settings` | `system_settings` audited key-value (incl. `eligibility_mode`) | `SettingsService` |
| `audit` | `audit_logs` writer + `/api/audit-trail/tickets/:id` viewer | `AuditService` |
| `org` | Org graph CRUD: zones, plants, companies, users, engineers, SE coverage/territory, SLA rules, scoring weights, common kit, geography (PostGIS), zone-mapping | 14 admin controllers; `plant-eligible-floating-se.service.ts` MV refresh |
| `ingestion` | Everything AutoPlant: master sync, snapshot worker, run ledgers, partitions, health, **ingestion scheduler** | see §3a/§3b; self-contained (own guards + `ScheduleModule.forRoot()`) |
| `device-state` | Set-based recompute, SLA buckets, eligibility modes | **imported only by IngestionModule** (`device-state.module.ts:12-13`); other consumers reach the table via their own Prisma (#105 territory) |
| `ticketing` | Ticket creation, query, troubleshoot submission, auto-recovery, repeat-escalation, vehicle-unavailability, non-op dual-confirm, recovery lifecycle, install create+lifecycle | 8 controllers |
| `devices` | Device list read + per-device cycles/downtime-trend + deal-type tag | `DeviceService`, `DeviceDetailService` |
| `recommender` | Candidate selection, hard filters, scoring, canonical sort → `recommendations` | consumed by SchedulingModule |
| `scheduling` | Batch dispatch, day-plan/schedule queries, ZM override, same-day update, dispatch-run + daily dispatch cron | `SchedulingModule` imports `RecommenderModule` (#113) |
| `business-sweep-scheduler` (in `scheduling/`) | 10 env-gated `@Cron` sweeps: verification, install-verification, intraday-timeout, cross-zone, repeat-escalation, soft-inactive, system-efficiency, 3 month-start cubes | leaf module (#108) |
| `intraday` | CRITICAL insertion offer state machine, accept/decline/timeout | #29/#30/#101 |
| `cross-zone` | Platinum auto-escalation + manual flag, approve/deny/defer/re-escalate | #32 |
| `shared-pool` | SE shared ticket pool | #12 |
| `planner` | SE planner grid CRUD + recommender bias | #14 |
| `dashboard` | Zone dashboard aggregates | #06 |
| `reports` | fleet-uptime, soft-inactive trend, root-cause, efficiency, ZM scorecard + aggregation services | #39–#44 |
| `soft-state` | SE soft states + activity ping | #15 |
| `verification` | GPS three-phase verification, review, fraud flag | #18/#19 |
| `inventory` | Van stock, ledger, shadow-use, zone warehouse stock | #21/#24/#73 |
| `component-request` | Request flow, WAITING_COMPONENT, WM queue, oversight | #22/#23 |
| `engineers` | SE directory/admin CRUD (Phase 4), availability, leave | `EngineerAdminService` |
| `roles` | Role-backup cascade + CSM acting scope | #27 |
| `notifications` | In-app spine + channel-gateway seam (no real external adapters — #76) | `NotificationService` |
| `vouchers` | Expense vouchers SE→ZM→OH finance | #38 |
| `me`, `zones` | Thin identity + zone-list controllers (AppModule-level, no module) | `me.controller.ts`, `zones.controller.ts` |

### 1.5 Branch / working-tree state at time of writing

- Branch `feat/autoplant-integration`; `main` exists but the integration line has **not** been
  promoted (INDEX.md:19 "Not yet promoted to `main`" — still true `[UNVERIFIED against remote]`).
- Uncommitted working tree: admin UI visual polish (overlay/shell/ui components, `index.css`),
  `devices.ts`/`schedules.ts` API clients, `device.service.ts`/`devices.controller.ts`,
  `zm-schedule-query.service.ts` + their tests, and a CLAUDE.md edit (git status at session start).
  This document describes the working tree as found.
- Standing trap: `.gitignore`'s `data/` rule untracks `apps/admin/src/components/data/` — the
  branch tip cannot build from a fresh clone (issue #114, open).
